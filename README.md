Description 

An android application focused on delivering a high-quality meal plan app for its consumers. Our app is multi-dimensional and has several use cases; a user can store ingredients and recipes, plan meals for upcoming weeks, and use the shopping list feature to buy and stock up on their ingredients. The autonomous nature of this app makes it highly appealing to a large general audience and we cannot wait for you to try it!


Installation and Usage

Once our app is moved from production to release, you can find it on the android play store! We will put a link to the app closer to release!


Authority and License 

This app is being developed by Ishaan Rehmani, Logan Timer, Neville Albuquerque, Samir Raza, Shiv Chopra and Scott Gebert as part of a group project deliverable for Computing Science 301 at the University of Alberta.
